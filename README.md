# Ask-Cortana
A browser extension that brings Edge's "Ask Cortana" right click option to Chrome and Opera 
This was a proof-of-concept browser extension. As a result, it works, but is not 100% functional. Some images are broken, context menus do not expand and page elements will sometimes overlap. But it works, and you can try it for yourself

# Installation

To install, clone the repo to your computer, then sideload the folder from the Chrome or Opera extensions page.
